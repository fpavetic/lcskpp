### LCSk++: Practical similarity metric for long strings

This is an implementation of the LCSk++ metric for long strings described in [1].

LCSk++ of two strings a and b calculates the longest common subsequence of two strings with
the restriction that the consecutive runs of indices in both strings have length at least k,
which is a parameter of the algorithm. For example: longest common subsequence of the strings
ABCDAB and ABCADB is of length 5 (ABCDB), while LCSk++ of these two strings with k=3 is 3 (ABC).
This restriction loses some matches, but allows for a faster computation.

### Implementation
* __lcskpp.h/lcskpp.cpp__  
   >> Implementation of several algorithms for computing LCSk++. The approach described in Section 3.2 of [1] can be found in the lcskpp_sparse_fast function.
* __fenwick.h__  
   >> Implementation of the Fenwick tree data structure used by the lcskpp_sparse_fast.
* __test_klcs.cpp__  
   >> A unit test for the algorithm.
* __random_strings.h__  
   >> Functions for generating random strings as described in Section 4.1 of [1].

### Dependencies
For compiling this library, it is necessary to have C++11 compatible compiler.
